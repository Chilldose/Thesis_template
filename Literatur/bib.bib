abstract = {An asymptotic nonlinear integrodifferential equation is derived for spontaneous instability of the plane front of a laminar flame. If the combustible mixture is deficient in the light component, spontaneous instability will lead to self-turbulization of the flame, and the flame front assumes a strongly nonstationary cellular structure. If there is an excess of the light component, spontaneous instability produces stationary, irregular wrinkles on the flame front, and the flame continues to propagate in a laminar regime. It is shown that in all cases spontaneous instability of the flame implies an increase in its propagation velocity.}

@article{Kuramoto1975,
abstract = {The origin of persistent wave propagation through medium of reaction-diffusion type is explored. Our theory is based on a generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation for a complex field W, namely, the equation derived previously in connection with the instability problems in nonlinear chemical kinetics. For slow variation of W in space and time the above equation is further reduced to a Navier-Stokes-like one for the phase gradient of W. Under a certain condition, the "viscosity" coefficient becomes negative, and at the same time the temporally ordered state of uniform concentrations becomes unstable. In such a situation we find a particular solution corresponding to a propagating concentration wave with a wave-source or sink.},

Des. 61-62 (2002) 263-271] and on a water-cooled divertor concept. \{PPCS\} model B is based on the \{HCPB\} blanket [M. Gasparotto et al., \{DEMO\} blanket technology R&amp;D results in the EU, Fusion Eng. Des. 61-62 (2002) 263-271] and on a helium-cooled divertor concept. For each of the more advanced concepts, models C and D, an advanced physics scenario has been identified and combined with advanced blanket concepts that allow higher thermodynamic efficiencies of the power conversion systems. Two key innovative developments are worthy of especial note: the development of a scheme for the scheduled replacement of the internal components and the conceptual design for a helium-cooled divertor. For all models, systems analyses were used to integrate the plasma physics and technology constraints to produce self-consistent plant parameter sets with approximately optimal economic characteristics. In the \{PPCS\} models, the favourable, inherent, features of fusion have been exploited to provide substantial safety and environmental advantages. The broad features of the conclusions of previous studies have been confirmed for the new models. Finally, the \{PPCS\} study has highlighted the need for specific design and R&amp;D activities in addition to those already underway within the European long term R&amp;D programme. "

The \{ODS\} variant of \{EUROFER\} shows superior tensile and creep properties compared to EUROFER.

A reliable joining technique for \{ODS\} and \{RAFM\} steels employing diffusion welding was successfully developed. "

For \{ITER\} knowledge has been accumulated by operation experience and dedicated tests in present tokamaks as well as by laboratory experiments and modelling. The rationale for the selection of \{PFMs\} in \{ITER\} (Be, W, carbon fibre reinforced carbon) is described with regard to the critical issues concerning PFMs, esp. erosion during transient heat loads and the T-inventory in connection with the redeposition of carbon. In the fusion reactor generation after \{ITER\} the very stringent conditions of increased surface power to be removed from the plasma, a lifetime requirement of several operational years, high neutron fluences and increased operation temperature are exerting even more severe constraints on the selection of possible materials. Comparing these boundary conditions with materials under development and their further potential, only a narrow path is left regarding heat sink and PFMs. In this context the investigations on W as first wall material carried out e.g. in \{ASDEX\} Upgrade are being discussed as well as laboratory results on W-based material systems. The implications of these results are the starting point of what should form a consistent programme towards plasma-facing and heat sink materials for a fusion reactor. "

@article{Oil,
abstract = {Crude oil, coal and gas are the main resources for world energy supply. The size of fossil fuel reserves and the dilemma that "when non-renewable energy will be diminished" is a fundamental and doubtful question that needs to be answered. This paper presents a new formula for calculating when fossil fuel reserves are likely to be depleted and develops an econometrics model to demonstrate the relationship between fossil fuel reserves and some main variables. The new formula is modified from the Klass model and thus assumes a continuous compound rate and computes fossil fuel reserve depletion times for oil, coal and gas of approximately 35, 107 and 37 years, respectively. This means that coal reserves are available up to 2112, and will be the only fossil fuel remaining after 2042. In the Econometrics model, the main exogenous variables affecting oil, coal and gas reserve trends are their consumption and respective prices between 1980 and 2006. The models for oil and gas reserves unexpectedly show a positive and significant relationship with consumption, while presenting a negative and significant relationship with price. The econometrics model for coal reserves, however, expectedly illustrates a negative and significant relationship with consumption and a positive and significant relationship with price. Consequently, huge reserves of coal and low-level coal prices in comparison to oil and gas make coal one of the main energy substitutions for oil and gas in the future, under the assumption of coal as a clean energy source. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Berg1999,
abstract = {Predicting the partial sputtering yield (sputtered atoms of one element/incident energetic ion) for different elements during sputtering from multielement targets is not a straightforward task. It is commonly observed that ion bombardment of composite targets exhibits preferential sputtering. Such processes are normally studied by computer simulations since theory gives qualitative results only. This work presents a systematic computational study of the major ballistically induced preferential sputtering effects taking place during ion bombardment of composite materials. It is shown that in a vast number of cases ballistic preferential sputtering is a dominant process particularly at moderate temperatures where thermodynamic effects are suppressed. In particular, sputtering from composite targets, resputtering during ion assisted deposition of composite films, sputtering of thin films onto heavy substrates, ion assisted deposition onto different substrate materials, sputter depth profiling, etc. are technological processes shown to commonly exhibit preferential sputtering. It is further shown that a number of sputtering situations exhibit along with the preferential sputtering the so called sputter yield amplification effect. The latter consists in that the partial sputtering yield of a given species is larger than the sputtering yield of the pure material. As a consequence, the sputtering yield of certain materials can be enhanced substantially by introducing small concentrations (a few percent) of impurity species in the target. The work provides ample examples of various situations of academic and technological interest where preferential sputtering and sputter yield amplification occur. The major ballistic mechanisms leading to preferential sputtering and sputter yield amplification are also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The current status of sputtering of and reflection from pure elements regarded as possible wall or divertor materials is reviewed for the bombardment with hydrogen isotopes and self-ions. The general behavior of sputtering and reflection on the projectile energy and angle of incidence as well as surface roughness is discussed. But in a fusion machine the atoms bombarding the walls and divertor plates have a broad energy and angular distribution. Therefore, computer simulation allows to study the dependence on a Maxwellian projectile distribution as a function of the edge plasma temperature which may be a more relevant description of the situation in a plasma machine. The case of multicomponent targets is more difficult and each system has to be studied individually. Preferential sputtering, usually the preferred emission of the lighter target species, changes the surface composition. Therefore, only a few examples will demonstrate the change of surface composition, sputtering and reflection, and depth profiles with fluence (time). Simultaneous bombardment with more than one species complicates further the situation, where an erosion dominated regime can change into a deposition dominated regime with time.},

@article{Kelly1978,
abstract = {Four aspects of the sputtering phenomenon are considered with reference to binary targets. (1) Direct energy transfer from the incident particles to surface atoms would be expected to cause an enrichment in the heavier component. (2) Energy transfer from the substrate to surface atoms would be expected to cause an enrichment in the less abundant component. (3) Effects relating to surface binding energies are most easily analyzed for alloys, the prediction being here that a target is enriched in the less volatile component. Finally, (4) effects leading to vapor pressures are considered. The actual responses of a rather large number of binary oxide and alloy targets are most simply summarized by noting the following: (a) CdO preferentially loses. O whereas ZnO does not; (b) both Al0.33 Au0.67 Au0.33 preferentially lose Al. As such we conclude that preferential sputtering with oxides is understandable in terms of vapor-pressure effects, though surface binding energies in principle also play a role. By contrast, preferential effects with alloys are understandable in terms both of direct energy transfer and of surface binding energies.},

abstract = {Numerous experimental data on changes of surface composition of ion-bombarded binary targets and advances in computer simulations of ion-solid interactions give grounds for discussion of characteristic features inherent to the effect of preferential sputtering. The current status of research on preferential sputtering in two-component targets under bombardment by 0.5-10 keV inert gas ions is reviewed. Both the experimental data and the results of computer simulations are discussed. The experimental data were carefully chosen so as to eliminate the effect of surface segregation. The emphasis is on the compositional changes of metal silicides and other semiconductor compounds bombarded at the room temperature and studied by AES using low-energy Auger lines (the information depth within 3-4 atomic layers). The main concern is with such subjects as: the effect of the ion energy on surface compositional changes under the steady-state conditions of sputtering; the dependence of the compositional changes on the angle of ion incidence; the influence of the bulk concentrations on the effect of preferential sputtering; correlation between the surface compositional changes and component masses and surface-binding energies. The experimental data are compared with the analytical theory of preferential sputtering. The latter is also compared with results of computer simulations by well-known Monte-Carlo codes TRIM.SP, TRIDYN, TAMIX and other numerical calculations in the framework of the binary-collision approximation. By such a way, the field of application of the theory is elucidated. The possible influence of the bulk binding energy on the effect of preferential sputtering is also briefly discussed. Experimental data on surface compositional changes of semiconductor compounds reported in the literature over the last decade are tabulated.},

@article{Roth2014,
abstract = {The performance of EUROFER steel under high flux low energy plasma bombardment is being analyzed. EUROFER contains, other than Fe and Cr, important concentrations of heavy elements with W being the most prominent component with 0.4at.{\%}. These different components in EUROFER will be eroded differently, leading to changes in surface composition and erosion yield. The plasma exposure was performed in the plasma generator PISCES-A with the parameter ranges of ion energies between 90 and 190eV, exposure temperatures between 80 and 500°C and fluences between 3×1023 and 6×1025m−2. The erosion yield was mainly determined by weight-loss measurement, and the surface composition after the exposure was analyzed by various ion beam analysis methods. For temperatures below 180°C the erosion yield of EUROFER was lower than for pure Fe already at the lowest fluence of 3×1023D+m−2, and decreased further to values of less than 1/10 of those for Fe at 6×1025D+m−2. Ion beam analysis showed the enrichment of W at the exposed surface correlating with the yield reduction; however, the experimental depth resolution of about 1nm did not allow resolving the predicted W enrichment within the first two monolayers. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the W enrichment is the only reason for the yield reduction or if surface oxidation and topography changes contribute to the observed effects. First results for different surface temperatures, however, indicated that at 500°C the erosion yield remains close to the values for pure Fe, indicating that the exposure temperature is also an important factor for the sputtering process of EUROFER.},

abstract = {We present a study of nanopattern formation on polycrystalline Ni surfaces upon low energy Ar ion bombardment. At low angles of ion incidence an isotropic, rough morphology develops on the surface while at grazing incidence a ripple structure parallel to the ion beam direction is formed (so-called perpendicular mode ripples). To explain this behavior we propose a model which is based on a combination of (a) surface roughening due to sputter yield variation between different crystalline grains and (b) anisotropic nonlinearity resulting from the oblique angle bombardment. By computer simulations we show that the combination of these two phenomena excellently reproduces the experimental behavior, in particular the dependence of the surface morphology on the ion incidence angle. Importantly, the formation of ripples at grazing incidence does not involve any linear instability, in strong contrast to the present model of the ripple formation process.},

abstract = {A quartz-crystal microbalance technique for measuring total sputter yields in ion-surface collisions is described. The electronic circuit to drive the quartz crystal ensures low noise and high frequency stability. By measuring the total sputter yields for impact of singly charged ions on LiF target films a sensitivity limit of 0.5{\%} of a monolayer per minute could be achieved.},

@article{Reinhard2,
abstract = {The investigation of erosion rates of material compositions, used in nuclear fusion devices as a rst boundary between the plasma and the reactor vessel, is a topic of current research. Therefore tungsten and tungsten-nitride surfaces need to be bombarded with mono energetic deuterium particles to measure sputter yields at high uences, using a highly sensitive quartz crystal microbalance technique [1]. The existing ion source SOPHIE [2] cannot provide sucient high ion currents to do these measurements in an acceptable amount of time, so a new measurement setup needed to be developed. The rst setup uses a sputter gun as an ion source in combination with a Wien velocity lter to analyse the ion beam and to check if a setup without this lter is possible to reach even higher ion currents. The measurements with the velocity lter showed, that a maximum ux of 7  1016D=m2=s could be reached. This is about a factor 10 higher than the ux generated with SOPHIE. Furthermore it could be shown that a setup without the velocity lter should be possible, as long as the purity of the working gas source is high enough. Removing the velocity lter lead to a ux of 1  1018D=m2=s which makes high unece measurements possible.},
